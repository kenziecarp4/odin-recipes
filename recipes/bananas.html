        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There is nothing more mouth-watering than a fried banana covered in cinnamon and honey. This recipe from <a href="https://onelittleproject.com/pan-fried-cinnamon-bananas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One Little Project</a> is simple and delicious.</p>
        <p>The prep time for this recipe is only 2 minutes and the cook time is only 8 minutes. Suggested serving size is 2-4, but, if you're me, it's 1. I recommend serving these atop a stack of pancakes.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 bananas cut into 1/2 inch slices</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 tbsp. butter</li>
                <li>2 tbsp. raw honey</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the cinnamon, butter and honey in a frying pan over medium-high heat until melted and combined.</li>
                <li>Add the banana slices and cook for 4 minutes until the bottoms start to caramelize and turn golden brown. Adjust the temperature and cooking time as needed so that they donâ€™t burn.</li>
                <li>Flip all the banana pieces and cook for another 4 minutes until the other side is golden brown.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately over ice cream, yogurt, pancakes or french toast.</li>
            </ol>
